              &nbsp;The rapid expansion of urbanization and the growth of
              Bengaluru City and its population particularly during the last two
              decades has resulted in undue and unforeseen pressures on the
              existing civic infrastructure. This has led to several
              environmental problems – such as high demand for housing
              accommodation, intensive land use converting more open spaces into
              unplanned housing layouts in the revenue sites, growth of slums,
              breaching of several lakes to provide lands for buildings and
              other amenities, including bus-stands, etc. felling of trees,
              degradation in the public utility services, a lowering in the per
              capita availability of water, woefully inadequate sewerage
              systems, discharge of sewage, sludge, effluents and other kinds of
              waste-water into storm water drains and natural drains resulting
              in severe pollution of the remaining lakes and waterways, etc.

            <li>
              &nbsp;It was on January 25, 1996 that a small group of
              professionals in various fields got together at a workshop that
              was organized under the auspices of the Department of Space,
              Government of India, in Bengaluru. The participants at the
              workshop were drawn from agencies, such as the Department of
              Space, the Indian Space Research Organization, the Forest
              Department,0 the University of Bangalore, Bangalore Metropolitan
              Regional Development Authority, the Bangalore Mahanagara Palike,
              the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board, the Bangalore
              Development Authority, the Karnataka State Pollution Control
              Board, Academic institutions and also some environmentalists. The
              participants at this brainstorming workshop reviewed the status of
              a number of environmental indicators, with reference to Bangalore
              City.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;The group observed that, between them, they had a great deal
              of talent and knowledge and experience available with them. Hence,
              they resolved to work in a cohesive manner, so that they could
              assist the various civic agencies and others in addressing at
              least some of the environmental problems that were confronting
              Bengaluru City.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;In order to have a vehicle which could tackle environmental
              issues in a cohesive manner, the group formed a Non-Governmental
              Organization, called the Environment Association of Bangalore
              (EAB). The first set of members – the founder-members – were drawn
              from various governmental agencies, such as the Department of
              Space and the Indian Space Research Organization, BWSSB, BDA, BMP,
              BMRDA, Forest Department and University of Bangalore. EAB has the
              strong feeling that with increased awareness, knowledge, skills,
              attitudes, values, and motivation, the responsible citizens can
              become more ecologically literate and act competently to build a
              sustainable future for humans and ecosystems.

              &nbsp;Over the years, the membership became more broad-based with
              persons drawn, inter alia, from industries, business
              organizations, media, research and development organizations, and
              educational institutions. EAB has grown considerably and now
              boasts of a membership of over 160 environmentalists.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;The founder-members observed that the Glass House of the
              famous Lalbagh Garden in Bangalore is a well-known and easily
              recognizable symbol. Hence, it was adopted as the emblem of the
              Environment Association of Bangalore (EAB). The founder members
              also made the EAB an affiliate of the Indian Environmental
              Association, Mumbai and the Water Environment Federation, USA.
              This was done so that there would be access to the latest
              technology and ideas elsewhere in India and the world. Further,
              the affiliation would also provide opportunities to members of EAB
              to participate in seminars, workshops, etc. elsewhere.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;The day-to-day matters of the EAB are managed by a Board of
              Directors, which is elected by the General Body for a three-year
              term.
            </li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;EAB also has an Advisory Council with eminent persons being
              invited to become members.
